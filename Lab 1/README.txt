1. Following files are the main programs which should be executed:
	a. Q1_driver_code.m
	b. Q2a_driver_code.m
	c. Q2b_driver_code.m
	d. Q3_driver_code.m
	e. Q4_driver_code.m

2. Other files are the function files which help in making the code generic.

3. Since lambda is chosen to be 0.5, the code runs sufficiently fast upto N = 160, for which the matrix size comes as 51200 x 160. Hence, the output files execute upto this value to calculate the error and order of convergence.
